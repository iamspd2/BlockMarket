# BlockMarket: A Decentralized Customer Loyalty Reward App

40% of company revenue is generated from repeated customers. Hence, customer retention is essential.

However, the customer loyalty programmes have many loopholes: complexities, low redemption rates, lack of transparency, brand specific offers.

We strive to overcome this by introducing a single transactional currency: $ilicoin.

Customers can use their reward points anywhere, anytime to avail an offer as per their choice of brand.

This will result in more customer interest and full transparency will be maintained for every party involved.

The DApp is meant for offline markets where they're falling behind in the race against online marketplace strategies.

A common reward programme will help these markets to generate more transactions, in mutual interest.


## How this works

Information about each animal and the subjects in a kingdom is loaded from
the creating user's Gaia storage. Images of the animal persona and territories
are loaded from the instance of the app where they were created.


## How to Setup

Clone the repo, cd to the project directory, run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
